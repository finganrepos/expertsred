## Some of the companies we've worked with

"There is no substitute for experience in getting the “idiom” of React Native and avoiding the numerous dark alleys around state management, performance tuning and third party module selection. Our team at Infinite Red... has provided this throughout our project."

#### Max Metral

GasBuddy

“The team at Infinite Red brought me from an idea, to reality. They worked with me and added a unique perspective to my project and created something beyond what I had imagined. They took the time to listen to what I needed and quickly made it something beautiful and cohesive! My experience with this design team was unparalleled!”

#### Deby Aho

Sellebrate

"We're building high visibility medical software for some of the world's leading firms. Infinite Red has been an invaluable and trusted partner with deep development expertise, excellent product vision, and the muscle to get the job done."

#### Steve Shreve

Crossover Health

"They took our prototype and built it into a working production MVP, and quickly adapted to changes as we did customer development."

#### Ed Nanale

## Community leaders

With over 30 open source projects, a screencast series, multiple books and published articles, and heavy involvement in the React Native communities, our team is leading the way. We've organized meetups and conferences as well as participated in many others as speakers and attendees. If it's relevant to the technologies we love, we'll probably be involved in some capacity.
